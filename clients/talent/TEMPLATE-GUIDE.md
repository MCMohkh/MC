### Multi-Role Artists — Notes

**Camp Sasi** (Writer · Director · Actor · Lyricist) — Most complex multi-role talent.
Recommended: Use `template-actor.html` as base (acting is most bookable).
In the `talent-roles` div, show all 4 role tags.
Add sections for both Filmography AND Writing Credits.

**Ajith Mohan** (Actor · Director) — Use `template-actor.html`.
Add a small "Directed" subsection beneath Filmography.

**Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari** (Actor · Singer) — Use `template-actor.html`.
Add a "Music" subsection listing any singing credits alongside Filmography.

**Sai Yogi G** (Actor · Lyricist · Writer) — Use `template-actor.html`.
Add a Writing Credits subsection.

**Thanmai Bolt** (Actress · Singer) — Use `template-actor.html`.
Add a Discography subsection.

**Rohit Penumatsa** (Writer · Director · Film Editor) — Use `template-writer-director.html`.
Add "Editor" as a third role tag. In Filmography, use "Writer · Director · Editor" as role badges.
